## Question 1: Can you describe your ideal workflow when it comes to front-end development? State what tools you use, any resources you might seek help from and anything else that might help you speed up development time.

Daily Scrum can be done within development team. Use version control to develop and collaborate with group of developers. Ideally, this would be Git or BitBucket.Choosing modern IDE like Visual studio code will also help as it will provide useful features like intellisense, to help developers while writing code. It also provides useful extensions written from other developers. For more detailed explanation, sometimes official documentation will also help. Stack Overflow is one of the most helpful sites to share problems among its vast community. To speed up development, Automation tools and task runners can be used. The most common tools are Grunt, Gulp and webpack. Following instruction produced by experienced developers to solve certain problem would help. Reading blogs post and article is my other preferred way while solving problems. You can always differentiate and compare different solution to reach best conclusion of given problem.


## Question 2: Can you explain a time where you have used both your creative imagination and technical skills to produce a piece of work?

Creating my own Personal portfolio which needed fresh design to build it attractive. Examining different bootstrap templates which suited my own content. I wanted to create unique and stand out website without spending much to download paid templates. While working on this portfolio and associated projects, I wanted to get it done in low budget with high quality and less code which. This was the time where I thought was close to produce desired work piece.
